<blockquote cite="https://www.worldenvironmentday.global/formatting.html">
    World Environment Day 2023 was a reminder that people’s actions on plastic pollution matters. The steps governments and businesses are taking to tackle plastic pollution are the consequence of this action.

    It is time to accelerate this action and transition to a circular economy.
